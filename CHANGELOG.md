# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are logged here, newest first.

## 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Insight Verifier** (`modules/insight_verifier.py`) — a deterministic,
  non-LLM fact-checker for Auto Analyst's Gemini-synthesized findings.
  Recomputes real statistics straight from the loaded DataFrame (row/column
  counts, per-column means/medians/nulls, category shares, pairwise
  correlations, bounded group-by means) and cross-checks every number a
  finding quotes against that reference set. Findings are now badged
  ✓ verified / ⚠ unconfirmed in the Auto Analyst tab, with a summary caption
  ("N finding(s) with confirmed figures"). Catches the classic agentic-EDA
  failure mode where an LLM's narration drifts from the data it was given,
  without any extra Gemini calls.
- **Test suite** (`tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt`) — Prism's
  first automated test coverage. 22 tests across `insight_verifier`,
  `anomaly` (IsolationForest flagging), and `auto_analyst` (plan fallback
  logic, result summarization, findings synthesis guardrails). Run with
  `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`.
- **Suggested next hypothesis** (`auto_analyst.suggest_followup_hypothesis`)
  — after an Auto Analyst run, Prism scans the loaded data directly (not
  LLM prose) for the single most promising column pair to formally test:
  the strongest numeric/numeric correlation above a "worth testing" bar,
  or failing that the numeric/categorical pair with the largest one-way
  ANOVA F-statistic among viable group counts. Shown as a "Suggested next
  step" card in the Auto Analyst tab with a one-click "Test in Stats Lab"
  button that pre-selects both columns. Deterministic, no extra Gemini
  calls. 5 new tests.
