# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are logged here, newest first.

## 2026-08-10 (Run 4)

### Added
- **Exportable Data Quality Scorecard** (`modules/data_quality.py`) —
  closes the "Data Quality Score with exportable scorecard" backlog item
  flagged, unbuilt, across three prior runs. The 0-100 Data Health Score
  and its 5-component breakdown already existed
  (`data_engine.get_health_breakdown()`) and weren't rebuilt; this adds
  what was missing — a JSON-exportable scorecard (download button on
  Overview), a Data Health Score section in the standalone HTML report,
  and an "✨ Explain this score with AI" narration button (same
  detector-then-interpreter, fingerprint-cached pattern as anomaly
  narration) that names which component is dragging the score down and
  what to fix first. This cycle's required agentic-AI-theme pick. 10 new
  tests (8 for the new module, 2 first-time coverage for `report.py`).

### Fixed
- Overview's "Missing Values by Column" / "Outliers (IQR method)" tables
  stayed dark-styled under the Arctic (Light) theme. Root cause:
  `st.dataframe` paints onto a `<canvas>` via glide-data-grid, which reads
  its colors from a JS theme object sourced from Streamlit's own React
  theme context (fixed dark, from `config.toml`) — a CSS `--gdg-*`
  override wins the cascade (confirmed via `getComputedStyle`) but never
  reaches the canvas pixels, and a theme-suffixed widget `key=` remount
  doesn't help either, for the same reason. Fixed by swapping these two
  tables to `st.table` (plain HTML, correctly themed), which surfaced a
  second bug — `st.table`'s own text color also doesn't inherit the
  active theme by default — fixed alongside.
- Mobile Atlas panel overlap at ~390px viewport width, flagged by two
  prior runs' screenshots and never fixed: the fixed-position side panel
  (328px wide, full height, no responsive breakpoint) covered nearly the
  entire phone screen. Now docks to the bottom edge and caps at 40vh
  below a 768px breakpoint instead of covering the viewport.
- 4 new tests (first coverage for `modules/theme.py`).

## 2026-08-10 (Run 3)

### Added
- **Anomaly narration** (`modules/anomaly.py`) — Gemini explains the
  pattern behind IsolationForest-flagged rows in plain English (data-entry
  errors vs. genuine rare events) with one suggested next action, from an
  "✨ Explain these anomalies with AI" button in the Anomaly Detection
  expander. Narration is cached per a fingerprint of the flagged set
  (row count + index/reason hash) so re-viewing the same result doesn't
  re-spend a Gemini call. Serves this cycle's agentic-AI priority theme —
  closes a backlog item both 2026-08-07 runs flagged and left open. 6 new
  tests.
- **Atlas proactive alert HUD** (`modules/atlas.py`) — an incremental
  JARVIS-copilot slice. The orb gains an `alert` visual state (amber
  double-ring pulse + "⚠ N new insight(s)" label) that lights up
  unprompted whenever a fresh dataset load surfaces a high-severity
  Auto-Insight finding — zero extra Gemini calls, reuses the
  already-computed `auto_insights.generate_insights()` list. Clears
  itself the next time Overview renders after the user has seen it.
  Closes the "Atlas Proactive Insights" backlog item both 2026-08-07 runs
  flagged but neither built. 7 new tests.
- Baseline pytest coverage for `auto_insights`, `regression_diagnostics`,
  and STL decomposition (`forecasting.decompose_series`) — 42 tests. The
  2026-08-07 run report claimed 82 tests for these three modules, but
  `git log -- tests/` showed none were ever actually committed; discovered
  during this run's audit and backfilled as a small fix.

### Fixed
- The Atlas side panel's small header orb (`.atlas-orb-sm`) had its size
  set in `modules/theme.py` but no background/gradient/animation — those
  rules lived only in `atlas.py`'s CSS block, injected solely by
  `render_orb()`, which is skipped whenever a dataset is active (the side
  panel replaces the floating orb). The header orb was effectively
  invisible for every state, not just the new `alert` one — pre-existing,
  just never visually exercised before this run's Phase 5 screenshot
  check caught it. Fixed by injecting the CSS from both call sites.
- `atlas.raise_alert()` and `atlas.clear_alert()` could run in the same
  Streamlit script pass (Overview is the default active tab, so a fresh
  upload while already on it hits both in one execution) — clearing would
  erase the alert before the browser ever painted it. Added a one-run
  grace flag so a newly raised alert survives to be seen first.

## 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Insight Verifier** (`modules/insight_verifier.py`) — a deterministic,
  non-LLM fact-checker for Auto Analyst's Gemini-synthesized findings.
  Recomputes real statistics straight from the loaded DataFrame (row/column
  counts, per-column means/medians/nulls, category shares, pairwise
  correlations, bounded group-by means) and cross-checks every number a
  finding quotes against that reference set. Findings are now badged
  ✓ verified / ⚠ unconfirmed in the Auto Analyst tab, with a summary caption
  ("N finding(s) with confirmed figures"). Catches the classic agentic-EDA
  failure mode where an LLM's narration drifts from the data it was given,
  without any extra Gemini calls.
- **Test suite** (`tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt`) — Prism's
  first automated test coverage. 22 tests across `insight_verifier`,
  `anomaly` (IsolationForest flagging), and `auto_analyst` (plan fallback
  logic, result summarization, findings synthesis guardrails). Run with
  `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`.
- **Suggested next hypothesis** (`auto_analyst.suggest_followup_hypothesis`)
  — after an Auto Analyst run, Prism scans the loaded data directly (not
  LLM prose) for the single most promising column pair to formally test:
  the strongest numeric/numeric correlation above a "worth testing" bar,
  or failing that the numeric/categorical pair with the largest one-way
  ANOVA F-statistic among viable group counts. Shown as a "Suggested next
  step" card in the Auto Analyst tab with a one-click "Test in Stats Lab"
  button that pre-selects both columns. Deterministic, no extra Gemini
  calls. 5 new tests.
- **Auto-Insight Engine** (`modules/auto_insights.py`) — proactive
  statistical insights surfaced automatically on every dataset upload, no
  button click required. Scans for highly skewed/heavy-tailed
  distributions, strongly/moderately correlated numeric pairs
  (multicollinearity warnings), missing-data severity, IQR-based outlier
  prevalence, near-constant columns, high-cardinality ID-like columns,
  class imbalance in low-cardinality categoricals, and exact duplicate
  rows. Findings are severity-ranked (high/medium/low) and shown at the
  top of the Overview tab, with an optional one-click Gemini narration
  that turns the raw findings into a stakeholder-readable paragraph. 23
  new tests covering every detector plus edge cases (empty/single-row/
  all-null data).
- **Regression Diagnostics Panel** (`modules/regression_diagnostics.py`) —
  added to ML Lab for regression targets. Fits its own statsmodels OLS
  (separate from ML Lab's sklearn baseline, since inference needs
  statsmodels' standard errors) and runs the standard diagnostic battery:
  residuals-vs-fitted, Normal Q-Q, and Scale-Location plots; Shapiro-Wilk
  normality; Breusch-Pagan heteroscedasticity; Durbin-Watson
  autocorrelation; and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) per feature for
  multicollinearity. Each check gets a plain-English verdict. 33 new
  tests, including coefficient recovery on synthetic data with known
  collinearity/heteroscedasticity.
- **Time Series Decomposition (STL)** — added to the Forecasting tab.
  Splits a time series into trend + seasonal + residual components via
  statsmodels' STL (robust to outliers by default), reusing the existing
  `prepare_series()` pipeline. Shows a 0-1 trend/seasonal strength score
  (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos heuristic) and a 4-panel observed/trend/
  seasonal/residual chart. 26 new tests, including an additive-
  reconstruction identity check and known-trend/seasonality recovery on
  synthetic data.

### Fixed
- `ai_analyst.call_gemini()` no longer crashes with a `TypeError` if the
  `google.generativeai` import failed (`google_exceptions` was `None`) —
  now matches on exception class name as a fallback. Also guards against
  safety-filtered or empty Gemini responses instead of raising on
  `response.text` access.
- `auto_analyst._summarize_result()` now truncates wide DataFrames (20+
  columns) and long string results before they're folded into the
  findings-synthesis prompt, avoiding an unbounded token cost on
  wide datasets.
