# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are logged here, newest first.

## 2026-08-10 (Run 4)

### Added
- **Ensemble Outlier Detection** (`modules/anomaly.py`) — a second
  detection mode alongside the existing single-model IsolationForest flow.
  Runs IsolationForest, Local Outlier Factor, and DBSCAN (eps auto-selected
  via the k-distance elbow heuristic, no manual tuning needed) independently
  over the same numeric columns and reports a per-row consensus count
  (1-3) plus which methods flagged it. Rows flagged by 2+ methods are
  ranked as high-confidence; a lone flag from one method is distinguishable
  from genuine multi-method agreement. New "🔬 Run Ensemble Detection"
  button in the Anomaly Detection expander, with per-method flag counts,
  a high-confidence filter, and an exclude-flagged-rows action. Serves this
  cycle's agentic-AI priority theme. 7 new tests.
- **Data Quality Scorecard** (`modules/scorecard.py`) — an exportable
  report built on top of the existing 0-100 Data Health Score
  (`data_engine.get_health_breakdown()`, unchanged): a letter grade (A-F),
  a ranked list of components scoring below 70% of their weight, a
  rule-based recommendation per weak component pointing at the specific
  Prism tool that fixes it, and an optional Gemini executive summary
  (cached per scorecard fingerprint). Exports as Markdown or JSON via new
  download buttons in Overview's "📋 Data Quality Scorecard (export)"
  expander. Closes the "Data Quality Score with Exportable Scorecard"
  backlog item flagged by every run since 2026-08-07. 11 new tests.

### Fixed
- Atlas side panel (`.st-key-atlas_side_panel`) no longer renders as a
  fixed 328px overlay below 640px viewport width — it was eating most of
  the screen at mobile-PWA widths (~390px) and squishing the rest of the
  page into an unreadable strip (flagged, not fixed, by the 2026-08-10
  Run 3 audit). Below 640px it now sits in the normal page flow as a
  height-capped, scrollable card instead. **Caveat** (see
  `.prism/audit_2026-08-10-run4.md`): this fixes the panel-overlay
  symptom specifically; a separate, deeper, pre-existing mobile
  content-squish bug remains open and needs its own dedicated pass.
- Overview's "Missing Values by Column" and "Outliers (IQR method)" tables
  stayed dark-themed under the Arctic (Light) theme — they're rendered by
  Streamlit's native `st.dataframe` grid, a separate component that reads
  its palette from `.streamlit/config.toml` once at page load and never
  re-themes. Added `ui.render_themed_table()` (plain HTML styled with
  Prism's own `--prism-*` CSS tokens, so it always tracks the live theme)
  and swapped these two tables onto it.

## 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Anomaly narration** (`modules/anomaly.py`) — Gemini explains the
  pattern behind IsolationForest-flagged rows in plain English (data-entry
  errors vs. genuine rare events) with one suggested next action, from an
  "✨ Explain these anomalies with AI" button in the Anomaly Detection
  expander. Narration is cached per a fingerprint of the flagged set
  (row count + index/reason hash) so re-viewing the same result doesn't
  re-spend a Gemini call. Serves this cycle's agentic-AI priority theme —
  closes a backlog item both 2026-08-07 runs flagged and left open. 6 new
  tests.
- **Atlas proactive alert HUD** (`modules/atlas.py`) — an incremental
  JARVIS-copilot slice. The orb gains an `alert` visual state (amber
  double-ring pulse + "⚠ N new insight(s)" label) that lights up
  unprompted whenever a fresh dataset load surfaces a high-severity
  Auto-Insight finding — zero extra Gemini calls, reuses the
  already-computed `auto_insights.generate_insights()` list. Clears
  itself the next time Overview renders after the user has seen it.
  Closes the "Atlas Proactive Insights" backlog item both 2026-08-07 runs
  flagged but neither built. 7 new tests.
- Baseline pytest coverage for `auto_insights`, `regression_diagnostics`,
  and STL decomposition (`forecasting.decompose_series`) — 42 tests. The
  2026-08-07 run report claimed 82 tests for these three modules, but
  `git log -- tests/` showed none were ever actually committed; discovered
  during this run's audit and backfilled as a small fix.

### Fixed
- The Atlas side panel's small header orb (`.atlas-orb-sm`) had its size
  set in `modules/theme.py` but no background/gradient/animation — those
  rules lived only in `atlas.py`'s CSS block, injected solely by
  `render_orb()`, which is skipped whenever a dataset is active (the side
  panel replaces the floating orb). The header orb was effectively
  invisible for every state, not just the new `alert` one — pre-existing,
  just never visually exercised before this run's Phase 5 screenshot
  check caught it. Fixed by injecting the CSS from both call sites.
- `atlas.raise_alert()` and `atlas.clear_alert()` could run in the same
  Streamlit script pass (Overview is the default active tab, so a fresh
  upload while already on it hits both in one execution) — clearing would
  erase the alert before the browser ever painted it. Added a one-run
  grace flag so a newly raised alert survives to be seen first.

## 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Insight Verifier** (`modules/insight_verifier.py`) — a deterministic,
  non-LLM fact-checker for Auto Analyst's Gemini-synthesized findings.
  Recomputes real statistics straight from the loaded DataFrame (row/column
  counts, per-column means/medians/nulls, category shares, pairwise
  correlations, bounded group-by means) and cross-checks every number a
  finding quotes against that reference set. Findings are now badged
  ✓ verified / ⚠ unconfirmed in the Auto Analyst tab, with a summary caption
  ("N finding(s) with confirmed figures"). Catches the classic agentic-EDA
  failure mode where an LLM's narration drifts from the data it was given,
  without any extra Gemini calls.
- **Test suite** (`tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt`) — Prism's
  first automated test coverage. 22 tests across `insight_verifier`,
  `anomaly` (IsolationForest flagging), and `auto_analyst` (plan fallback
  logic, result summarization, findings synthesis guardrails). Run with
  `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest`.
- **Suggested next hypothesis** (`auto_analyst.suggest_followup_hypothesis`)
  — after an Auto Analyst run, Prism scans the loaded data directly (not
  LLM prose) for the single most promising column pair to formally test:
  the strongest numeric/numeric correlation above a "worth testing" bar,
  or failing that the numeric/categorical pair with the largest one-way
  ANOVA F-statistic among viable group counts. Shown as a "Suggested next
  step" card in the Auto Analyst tab with a one-click "Test in Stats Lab"
  button that pre-selects both columns. Deterministic, no extra Gemini
  calls. 5 new tests.
- **Auto-Insight Engine** (`modules/auto_insights.py`) — proactive
  statistical insights surfaced automatically on every dataset upload, no
  button click required. Scans for highly skewed/heavy-tailed
  distributions, strongly/moderately correlated numeric pairs
  (multicollinearity warnings), missing-data severity, IQR-based outlier
  prevalence, near-constant columns, high-cardinality ID-like columns,
  class imbalance in low-cardinality categoricals, and exact duplicate
  rows. Findings are severity-ranked (high/medium/low) and shown at the
  top of the Overview tab, with an optional one-click Gemini narration
  that turns the raw findings into a stakeholder-readable paragraph. 23
  new tests covering every detector plus edge cases (empty/single-row/
  all-null data).
- **Regression Diagnostics Panel** (`modules/regression_diagnostics.py`) —
  added to ML Lab for regression targets. Fits its own statsmodels OLS
  (separate from ML Lab's sklearn baseline, since inference needs
  statsmodels' standard errors) and runs the standard diagnostic battery:
  residuals-vs-fitted, Normal Q-Q, and Scale-Location plots; Shapiro-Wilk
  normality; Breusch-Pagan heteroscedasticity; Durbin-Watson
  autocorrelation; and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) per feature for
  multicollinearity. Each check gets a plain-English verdict. 33 new
  tests, including coefficient recovery on synthetic data with known
  collinearity/heteroscedasticity.
- **Time Series Decomposition (STL)** — added to the Forecasting tab.
  Splits a time series into trend + seasonal + residual components via
  statsmodels' STL (robust to outliers by default), reusing the existing
  `prepare_series()` pipeline. Shows a 0-1 trend/seasonal strength score
  (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos heuristic) and a 4-panel observed/trend/
  seasonal/residual chart. 26 new tests, including an additive-
  reconstruction identity check and known-trend/seasonality recovery on
  synthetic data.

### Fixed
- `ai_analyst.call_gemini()` no longer crashes with a `TypeError` if the
  `google.generativeai` import failed (`google_exceptions` was `None`) —
  now matches on exception class name as a fallback. Also guards against
  safety-filtered or empty Gemini responses instead of raising on
  `response.text` access.
- `auto_analyst._summarize_result()` now truncates wide DataFrames (20+
  columns) and long string results before they're folded into the
  findings-synthesis prompt, avoiding an unbounded token cost on
  wide datasets.
